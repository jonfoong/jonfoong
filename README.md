Hi I'm Jonah, a former pol sci predoc transitioning to data science. In my research I used causal inference methods and randomized experiments to study social phenomena in developing/post-conflict regions. You can find more information on my academic projects [here](https://jonfoong.github.io/). 

I like most things data, particularly questions of methodology and projects that carry positive social impact. Some things that interest me at the moment are:

1. LLM, NLP methods like sentence transformers and RAGs to query speech databases
2. Probabilistic causal models, see [CausalQueries](https://github.com/integrated-inferences/CausalQueries)
3. Recreating minimal reprexes of traditional ML algorithms to reinforce my own understanding
4. Productivity tools in MlOps (vector databases, datalakes, etc)
